Description: Usfertilizer is used to explore and visualize the 
    county-level estimates of fertilizer, nitrogen and phosphorus, from 1987 
    to 2012.  The dataset were originally generated by USGS based on the sales
    data of commercial fertilizer. See \code{
    [here]<https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5851b2d1e4b0f99207c4f238/> }for details.  
    Usfertilizer utilized the tidyverse to clean the original data and provide 
    user-friendly dataframe. Please note that USGS does not endorse this package and this package
    does not include manure data. Also data from 1986 is not available for now.
